\blockquote{
  We build systems that lift the capabilities of programmers dealing with the vast complexity of modern software systems. Our systems automate away inessential complexity and automate in desired features â€” for example, securing programs that use hundreds of software dependencies, bolting distribution onto existing applications, and parallelizing large-scale pipelines built out of multi-language components. We characterize the behavior of the systems we build using real workloads seen in practice, often paired with mathematical models and proofs of key properties of interest.
