\blockquote{
  What little knew those men in dark \br
  atread upon that grove bespoke. \br
  They hearkened not the eldest lark \br
  yet sentinel for broken yoke: \br
  incarnate fen, though incorporeal, \br
  soft the firm made stifling mire \br
  writhing drew a hymn primordial \br
  groaning past in willow shire.
