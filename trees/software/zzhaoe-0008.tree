\p{Wikichan is a browser extension that displays a popup with information from Wikipedia and other sources when hovering over text on any page. Its development (2018 -- 2020?) was mainly during high school (and therefore a bloody mess) and is on indefinite hiatus. I'd like to return to it at some point, however.}
