\p{A symlink farm manager in the spirit of [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), meant primarily for dotfiles. Though I still use it for [my own configurations](zzhaoe-0007), it's pretty awful, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all. At some point, I'd like to build a robust and intelligent tool for these purposes.}
